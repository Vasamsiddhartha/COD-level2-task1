description :
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a significant subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human languages in a way that is both meaningful and useful. It bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding, encompassing a wide range of applications and tasks that revolve around text and speech data.
One of the core objectives of NLP is to teach machines to comprehend the context and nuances of language. This involves several key tasks such as:
1.Text Classification: Categorizing text into predefined categories, such as spam detection in emails or sentiment analysis where text is classified as positive, negative, or neutral.
2.Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying and classifying entities in text into categories like names of people, organizations, locations, dates, etc.
3.Machine Translation: Automatically translating text from one language to another, exemplified by applications like Google Translate.
4.Speech Recognition: Converting spoken language into text, which is fundamental for voice-activated assistants like Siri and Alexa.
